      <nav>
        <p>Julien and I decided to create an archive of old dead memes from the internet. We wished to create this collection to represent the internet's cultural shifts and evolution through the lens of our modern identity and general homogeneity of modern cultures and the internet. With each piece we've created a short description and a general timeline to showcase the evolutionary trends fades of the time.Through our combined effort we catalogue two sets of different eras of older memes one being those roughly around the early 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs and another set during the 2010‚Äôs.This piece can be seen as a time capsule for our generation to see the evolution of internet communication and humour.</p>
        <P>We felt it would be interesting to document the general meaning of the memes from early internet sub-culture before its mainstream connection to modern society. While also showcasing the more mainstream and semi modern memes from the early 2010s. We felt that internet culture during the early 1990 and 2000 itself was this isolated place, almost a different culture so these ‚Äòdead memes‚Äô can be seen as our early formation of internet lingo and phrases. While the 2010s would be the core concept and flesh out structure for what would become a meme and how these memes would be spread modern day through social media instead of how it was during those early years through message boards and word of mouth. Though it's mainly jokes, these memes play a role in internet culture and generally became the influence of how we communicate in the modern day.</P>
